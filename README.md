<h1>Face detection</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/6dmhbq5XsuQ)

<h2>Description</h2>
This face recognition system is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries including OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and face_recognition.

Files used:
1. face_recognition_system.py - Python script containing the face recognition system.
2. dataset.npy - Numpy file storing the dataset of face encodings.
3. readme.txt - This file containing information about the system and its sources.
4. MYDATASET1 - A folder containing a dataset created by manually downloading 10 images each for 21 celebrities of various ethnicities, sexes, and races, each with their own subfolder.


Code Sources:
1. Face recognition library: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition
2. OpenCV documentation: https://docs.opencv.org/
3. NumPy documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/
4. Matplotlib documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html

Datasets:
1. A dataset is created by manually downloading 10 images each from the internet for 21 celebrities of various ethnicities, sex and races each with their own subfolder, all compiled into 1 folder called MYDATASET1.

Instructions:
1. Run the face_recognition_system.py script.
2. Follow the menu options to perform various tasks such as inserting a new face, checking if a person is present in the dataset, deleting from the dataset, adding people automatically from a dataset directory, and listing the number of people in the dataset.
3. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed (cv2, numpy, matplotlib, face_recognition).
